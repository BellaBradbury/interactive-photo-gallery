-PROJECT OVERVIEW-
* In this project I created an interactive photo gallery using JavaScript and CSS Grid Layout. 
* Thumbnails and photos were provided with descriptions from Team Treehouse Academy. 
* At the top of the page, there is a search area where photos will hide and show depending on user input. 
* When the user clicks on a thumbnail, the photo displays in a lightbox. 
* There are "back" and "previous" arrows to cycle through photos.
